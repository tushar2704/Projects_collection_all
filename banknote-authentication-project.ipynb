Since I didn’t conduct any data cleaning process and pre-analysis here, so getting an accuracy of 65.3% is quite reasonable. However, if you are interested in optimizing the accuracy rate, you can consider conducting factor analysis to find the most influential variables to put into the models. Then you will get a better result! (For readers who are interesting in factor analysis, I found DataCamp has a good introductory article on factor analysis in python.)","metadata":{}}]}
